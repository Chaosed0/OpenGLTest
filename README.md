# [SpiderGame](https://straypixels.net/misc/SpiderGame.html)

SpiderGame is a first-person shooter I made over the course of 2016. I created it without an engine to prove to myself that I could.

While the gameplay is quite simple, I am very proud of the result. Some things I implemented in the game:

  - [Dynamic font texture packing](https://straypixels.net/texture-packing-for-fonts/)
  - [A quake-style dropdown console](https://straypixels.net/command-line-callbacks-cpp/)
  - Skinned animation
  - Entity-component-system architecture
  - A simple lighting system

 Libraries I used:

  - [Bullet physics](http://bulletphysics.org)
  - [Open Asset Importer](http://www.assimp.org)
  - [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org)
  - [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
  - [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/)
  - [Freetype](https://www.freetype.org/)
